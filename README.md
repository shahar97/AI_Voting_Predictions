# AI Voting Predictions

This repository contains code for an AI model that predicts the voting patterns of individuals based on their demographic information. The model uses a dataset of voting records and demographic information for individuals in the United States, and is built using Python and various machine learning libraries.

## Files

- `main.py`: This file contains the main code for the AI model. It imports the dataset and trains the model using various machine learning techniques, including logistic regression and decision trees. The final model is saved as a binary file using pickle.

- `dataset.csv`: This file contains the dataset used to train the AI model. It includes information on individual voting records and demographic information, including age, race, and education level.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all of the Python libraries required to run the AI model.

## Usage

To use the AI model, simply run `main.py` in a Python environment with all of the required libraries installed. The model will train on the dataset and output its predictions for new input data.
